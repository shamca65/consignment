Log on as provided user in buildIT
Navigate to account management
Select and copy PAT code
Open an incognito window and paste the link (testing new user)
Check mail trap for attempted activation email
Using the incognito window Log in as any other user and use the same link
Check mail trap again. (Message has more information when using CAC code)
Repeat steps but select CAC code this time through
Users: 
grood@treees.com
bob@nbc.com


The PAT email sends "Activation: Successful" which is tracking the success of the PAT link for the user. There may be a better name for this to get across to the rep what it actually means. I'll set the password for bobs user to 'pwd' so you can login with regular sign in (edited)
