 This deceptively simple application demonstrates saving re-useable form
information to a Magic Cookie. All elements are stored in one Cookie, and
restored on loading of the form. The data can be stored for any length of
time, editable in the JavaScript source. One of each of the form elements
that Netscape allows to be read are demonstrated here. All data
are stored on the client machine, there is no Server CGI involved. 
All the work is done by JavaScript, except serving up the original form
and script below. 

 Some minor bugs and gotchas:
1.)Macintoshes "onSubmit" submits the form before executing all the scripts
   so you need to push the save button ONCE first before pushing the "Order
   Book NOW". Or execute the "Order Book NOW" twice.
2.)If using a radio button you must put a "dummy" onClick=0 in each
   button. (see example). If you don't it will still work fine, but the 
   answers will be out of order, when the Client changes from Netscape 2.0
   to 3.0.
3.)If you have any IMG tags, *any* *at* *all* including little dividers
   or icons used as buttons, YOU MUST HAVE a HEIGHT and WIDTH argrument
   for EACH ONE!!! JavaScript simple does NOT work with out them!!!
4.)ENCTYPE=text/plain fails on all Mac platforms in the Form ACTION.
   So for now it is commented out.
5.)UNIX platforms do not correctly restore the SELECT and MULTIPLE SELECT
   fields. These problems seem to be fixed in Atlas and 3.xx versions.
6.)Netscape does not allow saving or restoring a "password" form element 
   type with javascript.

 Future enhancments:
In the newest version of Netscape's 3.0, JavaScript will allow one
to detect what type of form element is being used. So I will eventually
allow you to just LIST the elements that you would like to save and
restore. That will make adding these routines to a form MUCH MUCH
easier. 'Till then, here is at least is the functionality.

<P><b>Note:</b> Using Netscape on a Macintosh
you will have to submit (i.e., Order Book NOW) twice, the first will fail, or you
can push the "Save Changes and/or Set New Expiration" then Submit.
<BR><b>Note:</b> UNIX versions of Netscape 2.xx do NOT restore the SELECT and
MULTIPLE SELECT fields correctly. However, the fields are saved and 
mailed correctly. This problem seems to be fixed in Atlas and 3.xx 
versions. 
<BR><b>Neither</b> of these bugs affect its use in a
