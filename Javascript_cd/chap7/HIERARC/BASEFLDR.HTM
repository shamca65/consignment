Welcome. <br><br>
Hope you find whatever you're looking for. Here you have links to local documents 
with information about myself and some of the things I enjoy, as well as a very restrictive set of 
links to other places on the Web that I find useful and where I go back again and again. <br><br>
Browse this site using the <A HREF="fldrtree.html" target = "_top"><i>Folder-Tree</i></a> on the left side frame.
Click a folder to display more folders; click a local document to display its contents on the right frame; click on a link 
to open a new window with the chosen site; close the Start Folder to see this page again.<br><br>
Questions, comments, suggestions? Please <A HREF="mailto:martins@hks.com">mail</a> me.<br>
Have fun!<br>
