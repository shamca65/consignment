<!-- This hidden form *must* appear before the HTML specifying
     the framesets. This insures that it is loaded prior to any
     of the search documents -- important because it contains
     your database for searching. One final note: do not omit 
     the asterisk at the end of the "find" value, or the parser
     will miss "seeing" your last record. -->
