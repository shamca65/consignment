<h1>Why Boojum?</h1>
<h2>&quot;For the Snark was a Boojum, you see!&quot;</h2><p>

This started life as Justin Boyan's JavaScript <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jab/snark/">Snark search engine</a>. Now that I've modified it, it is a Boojum.<p>

If you look at the Boojum page with a non-JavaScript capable browser, you will see nothing. The Snark in <a href="http://www.astro.indiana.edu/personnel/link/Snark.html">Lewis Carroll's poem</a> was rather like his Cheshire Cat in that it kept vanishing away. 

If you want to know more, look at the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jab/snark/faq.html">Snark FAQ</a>.<p>

<ul><li>To use the Boojum, you must have a browser that is capable of forms and JavaScript, such as <a href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">Netscape v2.0</a> or better.
<li>Enter your search terms in the form and select your preferred search engine. You can easily search again with another search engine.
<li>You can resize the search panel (to zero size if you want) and so enlarge the display window.
<li>You may prefer to use the <b><a href="http://www.jesus.org.uk/snark/snark.html" target="_top">Snark-to-Go</a></b> floating window instead
<li>The normal Jesus Army <b><a href="http://www.jesus.org.uk/search.html" target="_top">Search page</a></b> has links to some other search engines as well
